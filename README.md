# FC Recover

This is a small recovery tool that I built for people who lost their Farcaster Recovery Phrase and changed their recovery address to their personal address. This tool will help you get a new login phrase to use for the Warpcast Client.

This uses BIP-39 Scheme to generate mnemonics, you can also bring your own!

If you've any issues, drop me a text on [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/dakshk.eth) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xDak)
